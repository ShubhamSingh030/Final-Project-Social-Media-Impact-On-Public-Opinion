# Analyzing Social Media Influence on Public Opinion
# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze social media data to understand public opinion trends. We focus on various aspects of engagement and sentiment to assess how social media influences public perception over time.

# Datasets
The project utilizes four datasets:

# tweets_data
Columns: date, tweet, likes, retweets, time, hour
Contains tweet details, engagement metrics (likes and retweets), and timestamp information.

# covid_tweets dataset
Columns: date, tweet, sentiment
Contains tweets related to COVID-19 with sentiment scores

# reddit dataset
Columns: clean_comment, category
Contains cleaned Reddit comments categorized for analysis.

# twitter data
Columns: clean_text, category
Contains cleaned Twitter texts categorized for analysis.

# Goals
# Understand User Engagement: Analyze how likes, retweets, and comments reflect public opinion.
# Time-Based Analysis: Examine how sentiment or engagement changes over time.
# Sentiment Distribution: Determine the overall sentiment in the data.
# Text Analysis: Identify the most common words or topics in the data.

# Data Analysis Workflow
# Data Cleaning: Initial preprocessing and cleaning of datasets.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
# Investigate user engagement metrics.
# Analyze sentiment trends over time.
# Explore sentiment distribution.
# Perform text analysis for common words and topics.

# Feature Engineering: Transform sentiment data into numerical features for modeling.
# Modeling: Develop and evaluate models to understand sentiment and engagement patterns.

# Modeling
The Random Forest Classifier has been identified as the best model for predicting public opinion trends based on our analysis.

# Visualization
Findings and models will be showcased using Power BI to provide interactive and insightful visualizations.
